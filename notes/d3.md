# Using D3

D3 lives on the client side, so you can include it by downloading it or by putting it into the HTML doc like `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>`.

Because of this, we will need something like Socket.io to transfer the data from the server/database back to the client side. I believe Electron has something we can use built in.

## Selectors

D3 works a lot like jQuery or vanilla client side JS, in that you have to select html elements. So, an example of selecting something would be like follows:

```javascript
d3.selectAll("p").style("color", function(d, i) {
  return i % 2 ? "#fff" : "#eee";
});
```

You take the `d3` object and begin chaining commands. This is pretty intuitive for us. `style` effects CSS... The function being passed in, is an option given by D3, it contains the data being passed in as well as the index of where that data is. So, this in theory would select all paragraphs and color the font of every other paragraph a different shade of gray. Here's another example:

``` javascript
d3.selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
    .style("font-size", function(d) { return d + "px"; });
```

This selects all paragraphs, then takes in data (the array of numbers), then changes the CSS `font-size` so that each number in the data is the pixel size of the data. So 4 would be `4px` and 8 would be `8px` etc...

## Enter and Exit

The `enter()` and `exit()` functions act as going in or out deeper into the selected element. So, say your in a `div` and want to add a child `p` element. You would `enter().append("p")` or here's another example:

``` javascript
d3.select("body")
  .selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .enter().append("p")
    .text(function(d) { return "Iâ€™m number " + d + "!"; });
```
